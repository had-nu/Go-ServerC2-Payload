A simple Command and Control (C2) server and payload written in Go. The server listens for incoming TCP connections on port 8080 and executes commands received from the payload client, returning the output. This project is designed for educational purposes and to demonstrate basic network programming in Go.

## Description

This repository contains two main components:
- **`server.go`**: A TCP server that listens on port 8080, accepts commands from clients, and executes them using the system's shell (`/bin/sh` on Linux). It supports multiple commands per connection.
- **`payload.go`**: A client that connects to the server, sends a predefined list of commands, and displays the responses.

Both components use `bufio.Reader` for robust handling of variable-length input/output and are configured for Linux environments.

## Ethical Hacking Disclaimer

This project is intended **solely for educational purposes and ethical security research**. It demonstrates basic C2 functionality and should only be used in controlled environments where you have explicit permission to test (e.g., your own systems or networks). Unauthorized use of this code to harm systems, networks, or individuals is strictly prohibited and illegal. Itâ€™s open for collaboration, but use it responsibly in authorised settings only. My intent is to empower security pros and students, not enable misuse.

See the Code of Conduct file.

**Use responsibly and ethically.**

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.24 or later installed (`go version` to check).
- A Linux environment (tested on Ubuntu/Debian).
- Basic networking setup (ensure port 8080 is open and accessible).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/had-nu/Go-ServerC2-Payload.git
	cd Go-ServerC2-Payload
	```
2. Start the server
	``` bash
	go run server.go
	```

3. Run the payload
	``` bash
	go run payload.go
	```

The payload will connect to the server (`default: 127.0.0.1:8080`), send commands, and display the responses with a 2-second delay between each command.

The server listens on :8080. Modify the port in `server.go` if needed:
``` bash
ln, err := net.Listen("tcp", ":8080")
```
The payload connects to `127.0.0.1:8080`. You can update the IP/Port in `payload.go` as well:
``` bash
conn, err := net.Dial("tcp", "127.0.0.1:8080")
```
Edit the `commands` slice in `payload.go` to customaise the commands sent:
``` bash
commands := []string{
    "whoami",
    "ip addr",
    "pwd",
    "ls",
}
```

The Server Output must be something like that:
``` bash
$ go run server.go
C2 server started on port 8080
Listening on [::]:8080
New connection from 127.0.0.1:54321
Received command: /usr/bin/whoami
Response sent: user
Received command: /sbin/ip addr
Response sent: 1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
[... truncated ...]
```

## Limitations

While functional for educational purposes, this C2 server and payload system has several notable limitations:

1. **Static Command List in Earlier Versions**  
   The payload contained a static list (`commands := []string{...}`) that was executed sequentially, limiting flexibility. While this has been improved to allow remote command execution, older versions lacked the ability to dynamically receive commands from the server.

2. **Platform Dependency**  
   The current implementation is tailored for Linux, using `/bin/sh` for command execution. It does not natively support other operating systems like Windows or macOS without manual adjustments to the command execution logic.

3. **Lack of Encryption**  
   Communication between the server and payload is unencrypted, making it vulnerable to interception or tampering over unsecured networks. Sensitive data or commands could be exposed to attackers without additional security measures like TLS.

4. **Single-Threaded Command Handling**  
   The server processes commands from a single client sequentially in each connection. It cannot handle multiple payloads concurrently without significant delays, limiting scalability for scenarios involving multiple compromised machines.

## Future improvements

1. **Remote Command Execution**  
   Modify the payload to act as a persistent client that connects to the C2 server and waits for commands sent remotely. The payload would execute these commands on the compromised machine and return the results to the server.

2. **Cross-Platform Support**  
   Enhance the payload and server to detect the operating system (e.g., using `runtime.GOOS`) and adapt command execution accordingly (e.g., `/bin/sh` for Linux, `cmd.exe` for Windows). This would make the tool versatile across different environments.

3. **Encryption with TLS**  
   Implement Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt communication between the server and payload. This would prevent eavesdropping and ensure that commands and responses remain confidential, making the system more secure for real-world testing scenarios.
