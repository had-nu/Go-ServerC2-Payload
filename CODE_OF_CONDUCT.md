# Code of Conduct

## Our Purpose

This project is an open-source demonstration of basic C2 (Command and Control) functionality, created solely for educational purposes and ethical security research. It’s designed to help cybersecurity professionals and students understand C2 mechanisms in a safe, controlled manner. We welcome collaboration, but with an unwavering commitment to responsible, ethical, and legal use in authorised environments only.

## Ethical Use Guidelines for a C2 Tool

### 1. Authorised and Controlled Use Only
- This C2 tool must only be used in **controlled environments** where you have **explicit permission** to test—such as your own systems, networks, or lab setups explicitly designated for security research. Unauthorised use to access, manipulate, or harm systems, networks, or individuals is strictly prohibited, illegal, and can lead to severe legal, financial, and ethical consequences.  
- Always comply with local laws, regulations, and organisational policies. Using this tool on systems or networks without consent is a criminal offence in many jurisdictions.

### 2. No Malicious Use
- This tool must not be used to develop, deploy, or support malicious activities, including but not limited to malware, ransomware, unauthorised surveillance, or cyberattacks. It is intended for **learning and defensive research**, not offensive or harmful purposes.  
- Do not use this project to exploit vulnerabilities, disrupt services, or cause harm to any individual, organisation, or infrastructure.

### 3. Transparency and Accountability
- If using this tool for research or educational purposes, be transparent about your methods and intent. Clearly document that your activities are conducted in a controlled, authorised environment.  
- Do not share or distribute this tool in ways that could enable misuse by others. If you suspect someone might misuse it, report it immediately (see below).

### 4. Community Collaboration
- We encourage contributions to this project—whether through code, feedback, or ideas—but expect all contributors to uphold these strict ethical standards.  
- Be respectful, constructive, and inclusive in all interactions, whether on GitHub, forums, or other platforms tied to this project. Harassment, discrimination, or harmful behaviour will not be tolerated.

## Our Commitment

As the creator of this C2 tool, my intent is to empower cybersecurity professionals and students to learn about C2 mechanisms in a safe, ethical way. This project is not intended to enable misuse, harm, or illegal activities. I’m committed to maintaining a community where contributors and users feel safe, respected, and aligned with the project’s educational mission.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter or suspect misuse of this tool—such as unauthorised access, malicious deployment, or unethical activities—or if you witness behaviour that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it to me directly via GitHub Issues or email (insert contact if desired). All reports will be reviewed promptly and handled with discretion.

## Consequences of Misuse

- Misuse of this C2 tool in violation of these guidelines, including any malicious or unauthorised activities, will result in an immediate ban from contributing to the project.  
- I reserve the right to report illegal activities to the appropriate authorities and cooperate fully with law enforcement if necessary.

## Final Note

Let’s build a community that champions ethical cybersecurity research, supports learning, and drives responsible innovation. Use this C2 tool to grow your skills and knowledge—but always with integrity, transparency, and respect for legal and ethical boundaries. Together, we can ensure this project remains a force for good in the security community.
